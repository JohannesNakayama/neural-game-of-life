# Teaching a Neural Network to Play Conway's *Life*

The goal of this project is to teach a neural network to play Conway's mathematical game *life*.  I was looking for a way to practice deep learning and this seemed to be a convenient task: It is very easy to implement *life*, so I am not dependent on the accessibility of open training data, I can simply generate it myself. 

There are implementations of life (without periodic boundary conditions) in Julia and Python in this repository. I did the Julia implementation first, but exchanging the data between Julia and Python turned out to be somewhat tedious, so I rewrote the entire thing in Python. 

### Next Steps

* get comfortable with PyTorch
* play around with some model architectures
